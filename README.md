# Parallel Data Processing and Modeling for Trip Analysis

## Project Overview
This project implements **parallel data processing** and **machine learning models** to analyze trip data, specifically focusing on understanding the number of people staying at home and the distances they travel when not at home. The project compares the performance of sequential and parallel processing methods and utilizes models such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** for predictive analysis.

### Key Features:
- **Data Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets using parallel processing.
- **Modeling**: Application of machine learning models (Linear Regression and Random Forest) for trip data analysis.
- **Performance Comparison**: Evaluation of processing speeds between sequential and parallel methods.
- **Visualization**: Plots for comparing the processing time and showing the speedup of parallel processing.

## Getting Started
